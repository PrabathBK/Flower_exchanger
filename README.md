# Flower Exchanger

A lightweight trading system simulator developed using C++ as the final project for the **High-Performance and Mission-Critical Software Development** workshop conducted by **London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG)**.

## Overview

This project simulates a basic trading engine that reads order data from CSV files, processes matching logic, and generates an execution report. It was designed with a focus on performance, modularity, and clean code structure.

## Contents

- `flower_exchange.cpp` – Core implementation of the matching engine.
- `flower_exchange.exe` – Compiled executable (for Windows).
- `execution_rep.csv` – Output execution report after matching.
